━━━┫ Unicode ┣━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Unicode, formally The Unicode Standard,[note 1] is a text encoding standard maintained by the
Unicode Consortium designed to support the use of text written in all of the world's major writing
systems. Version 15.1 of the standard[A] defines 149813 characters[3] and 161 scripts used in
various ordinary, literary, academic, and technical contexts.

Many common characters, including numerals, punctuation, and other symbols, are unified within the
standard and are not treated as specific to any given writing system. Unicode encodes thousands of
emoji, with the continued development thereof conducted by the Consortium as a part of the
standard.[4] Moreover, the widespread adoption of Unicode was in large part responsible for the
initial popularization of emoji outside of Japan. Unicode is ultimately capable of encoding more
than 1.1 million characters.

━━━┫ Codespace and code points ┣━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

⌘ Title 3

The Unicode Standard defines a codespace:[58] a sequence of integers
called code points[59] covering the interval [ 0 , 17 × 2 16) {\displaystyle [0,17\times 2^{16})},
notated according to the standard as U+0000–U+10FFFF.[60] The codespace is a systematic,
architecture-independent representation of The Unicode Standard; actual text is processed as binary
data via one of several Unicode encodings, such as UTF-8.

In this normative notation, the two-character prefix U+ always precedes a written code point,[61]
and the code points themselves are written as hexadecimal numbers. At least four hexadecimal digits
are always written, with leading zeros prepended as needed. For example, the code point U+00F7 ÷
DIVISION SIGN is padded with two leading zeros, but U+13254 𓉔 EGYPTIAN HIEROGLYPH O004 () is not
padded.[62]

There are a total of 220 + (216 − 211) = 1112064 valid code points within the codespace. (This
number arises from the limitations of the UTF-16 character encoding, which can encode the 216 code
points in the range U+0000 through U+FFFF except for the 211 code points in the range U+D800 through
U+DFFF, which are used as surrogate pairs to encode the 220 code points in the range U+10000 through
U+10FFFF.)
